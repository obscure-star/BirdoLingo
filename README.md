Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## Summary

**BirdoLingo** is an android app that teaches dogs how to speak other animals' languages!

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: üêàüêïüòå

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Pick an app screenshot to duplicate
  

- [X] Create a runnable app that displays an Animal Version of your chosen screenshot
- [X] Layout uses one (1) or more ConstraintLayout
- [X] Layout uses one (1) or more ImageView
- [X] Layout uses three (3) or more TextViews

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [X] Create a custom-shape Button using Shape Drawables
- [X] Customize the text fonts by creating new Font Resources
- [X] Add Tooltips to your Views to help users understand how to navigate the UI
